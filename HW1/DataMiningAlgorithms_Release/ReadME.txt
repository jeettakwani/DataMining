Main files are in DataMiningAlgorithms_Release folder. Libraries that are needed are provided in "libraries" folder.

The data folder has all the data files that we use for the algorithms.
1) Linear Regression: linear-regression-train.csv, linear-regression-test.csv
2) Decision Tree: weather-nominal.arff

The output text file generated after successful execution of an algorithm will be stored
in the respective algorithm folder inside the output folder.
for example: After successful execution of linear regression algorithm you will find the
output file in DataMiningAlgorithms/output/linear_regression

Additional Information: You can change the input for an algorithm in two ways
1) You can paste your file in the data folder, and change the name of input file in code.
2) You can change the name of your file to the default name give to input file and replace the
default input file with your file in data folder.
